# inferring-location-based-on-sun-path
Developing algorithm to run on a device which measures light intensity of the half of the visible sky - moving the sensor zero degrees to ninety degrees verticaly and zero degrees to 180 degrees horizontaly. The algorithm should be able to infer the location of the device based on the Sun's path throughout the day.
